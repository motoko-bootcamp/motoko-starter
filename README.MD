We're thrilled to introduce the Internet Computer, a remarkable innovation combining cryptography, math, computer science, and blockchain technology.
Despite the incredible technology we believe that the true value of a network lies in a passionate community, and during this Bootcamp, you'll learn from diverse developer mentors and contributors that are active member of the community, giving their time to make this event possible.

Our goal is to transmit both technical knowledge and enthusiasm for the Internet Computer as a force for a better future. We believe in its potential to create a fairer, more hopeful world, and hope the insights and connections you make this week contribute to that goal.
