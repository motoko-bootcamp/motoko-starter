## Introduction
Congratulation! <br/>
If you are reading this, it means you have successfully completed the 5 previous projects and you are now officialy a graduate from the **Motoko Bootcamp: Starter edition** 🧑‍🎓 👏

This diploma will give you access to the Motoko School, where you'll be able to keep learning and building connexion within the next wave of builders 🦸‍♂️

This is a big milestone, but **remember**, it's just the start. There will be a lot of additional challenges waiting for you on the road to achieving your dreams. 
And...yes, in case you're wondering, there will be more Bootcamps!

> This project is not a requirement for graduation, but it is essential if you wish to **graduate with honors**. Completing this project will enhance your chances of finding an opportunity within the ecosystem by showcasing your skills. This is also a way to leave your mark at the school, because your project will be added to our prestigious repository, showcasing students achievements.

## 🧑‍🏫 Requirements
### Step 1: A choice 🤔
Select one of the previous project.
- [Calculator](../../day-1/project/README.MD)<br/>
- [Homework Diary](../../day-2/project/README.MD)<br/>
- [StudentWall](../../day-3/project/README.MD)<br/>
- [MotoCoin](../../day-4/project/README.MD)<br/>
- [The Verifier](../../day-5/project/README.MD)

### Step 2: Motoko 👻
Feel free to add, remove, modify any functionality of the project you are working on! <br/> However, keep in mind the initial spirit of the project. If necessary, read the introduction for the selected project again. Remember, knowing why we're building something is just as important as the building part itself
### Step 3: Building the frontend 🧑‍🎨
What would be a successful project without a beautiful interface?  

1. Create a front-end structure with [create-ic](https://github.com/peterpeterparker/create-ic). 
2. Allow users to login with at least an Internet Identity account, you can also add more wallet support if you want.
3. Connect the front-end with the back-end so people can interact with your Motoko code.
4. Add an [ICP banner](https://dfinity.frontify.com/d/XzkdhhDptijE/dfinity-brand-guide#/internet-computer/powered-by-crypto-badges) to showcase what great technology you have used. 
5. Make it pretty! 🤩 

### Step 4: Deploy and share with the world.🖖
You will deploy both your backend and frontend canister on the IC network. Share it with your fellow students, friends, family or even on socials! 
Publish your project and make it public on GitHub, you'll need to submit the repository link in the graduation form.

Now, you can finally take a break and enjoy! ☀️
