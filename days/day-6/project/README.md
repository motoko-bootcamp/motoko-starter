# The Dapp 🚀
## 🧑‍🏫 Requirements
The idea is to transform of one few sample project you've been working on into a full fledged IC application! 
For instance: 
- You can decide to add a visual interface (website) for the calculator and deploy it on the network. 
- You could decide to deploy the MotoCoin and transform into a real-world token, following the [ICRC_1 standard](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1).
- You could create an incredible animated website for the Student Wall and deploy it on the network.
### Step 1: A choice 🤔
You'll need to select one of the previous project. Feel free to choose the one that inspires you the most.
- [Calculator](../../day-1/project/README.MD)<br/>
- [Homework Diary](../../day-2/project/README.MD)<br/>
- [StudentWall](../../day-3/project/README.MD)<br/>
- [MotoCoin](../../day-4/project/README.MD)<br/>
- [The Verifier](../../day-5/project/README.MD)

### Step 2: Motoko (Backend) 👻
Feel free to add, remove, modify any functionality of the project you are working on! <br/> However, keep in mind the initial spirit of the project. If necessary, read the introduction for the selected project again. Remember, knowing why we're building something is just as important as the building part itself.

### Step 3: Building the frontend 🧑‍🎨
What would be a successful project without a beautiful interface?  

1. Create a front-end structure with [create-ic](https://github.com/peterpeterparker/create-ic). 
2. Allow users to login with at least an Internet Identity account, you can also add more wallet support if you want.
3. Connect the front-end with the back-end so people can interact with your Motoko code.
4. Add an [ICP banner](https://dfinity.frontify.com/d/XzkdhhDptijE/dfinity-brand-guide#/internet-computer/powered-by-crypto-badges) to showcase what great technology you have used. 
5. Make it pretty! 🤩 

You'll find a few resources that can help you for frontend development, in the [following document](./HELP.MD).

### Step 4: Deploy and share with the world.🖖
You will deploy both your backend and frontend canister on the IC network. Share it with your fellow students, friends, family or even on socials! 
Publish your project and make it public on GitHub, you'll need to submit the repository link in the graduation form.

Now, you can finally take a break and enjoy! ☀️ 

> Thanks to your fellow student Wannes for contributing to this Day 6 challenge 😎
