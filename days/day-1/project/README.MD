# Calculator ➕✖️➖➗
On your first day of class, you enter the halls, eager to embark on the journey of a lifetime. Little do you know that you have forgotten to bring one essential tool to class — a **calculator**. 😳 <br/> 

Your professor, a renowned expert in the community, begins the day's lesson by presenting a series of complex mathematical problems that require the use of a calculator. The students around you huddle together, pulling out their calculators to tackle the challenge. 💪 <br/>

As you search your bag in vain for your calculator, you realize that you have inadvertently left it behind. Instead of panicking or admitting defeat, your resourceful nature kicks in. You decide to rely on your intelligence and aptitude in Motoko to create your own calculator. 🧑‍💻
## 🧑‍🏫 Requirements 
Your task is to create the code for a **calculator**, which is implemented as a canister. 
<br/> The canister should have a public interface that allows users to perform calculations. The canister has a memory variable called `counter` which represents the result of the most recent calculation.
## 📒 Steps
1. Define a mutable variable called `counter` of type `Float` that will be used to store the result of the most recent calculation.
2. Implement `add`, which accepts a value `x` of type `Float` and performs addition. 
3. Implement `sub`, which accepts a value `x` of type `Float` and performs subtraction.
4. Implement `mul`, which accepts a value `x` of type `Float` and performs multiplication.
5. Implement `div`, which accepts a value `x` of type `Float` and performs division. Make sure to guard against division by 0.
6. Implement `reset`, which reset the value of  `counter` by setting its value to zero.
7. Implement a `query` function `see` that returns the value of `counter`.
8. Implement `power`, which accepts a value `x` of type `Float` and returns the value of `counter` to the power of `x`.
9. Implement `sqrt`, which  returns the square root of `counter`.
10. Implement `floor`, which returns the largest integer less than or equal to `counter`.
11. Deploy the `Calculator` on the Internet Computer.
## 📺 Interface
> At the end of the project, your canister should implement the following interface.
```motoko
actor {
    add : shared(x : Float) -> async Float;
    sub : shared(x : Float) -> async Float;
    mul : shared(x : Float) -> async Float;
    div : shared(x : Float) -> async ?Float;
    reset: shared () -> async ();
    see: shared query () -> async Float;
    power: shared (x : Float) -> async Float;
    sqrt: shared () -> async Float;
    floor: shared () -> async Int;
};
```
