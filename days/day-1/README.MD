# Day 1️⃣
Welcome to the elite [Motoko School](https://twitter.com/MotokoSchool), where talented minds like yours gather to learn and master the art of programming on the **Internet Computer**. ♾️ <br/>  
Today marks your exciting first day, and while it may be intense, take the chance to bond with your teammates and brace yourself for the adventure ahead. Don't worry if you fall behind; allow yourself the time needed to grasp the material. Keep in mind that 7 days is a brief period to learn everything there is to know about Web 3.0 and the Internet Computer. All resources will be available after the week is over, so you can catch-up on anything you've missed. <br/>
Above all, the most vital aspect of the Bootcamp is to have fun and build connections - let's learn and grow together. 💪

## 🎯 Learning objectives
> **Before you finish your day**, review the following list and ensure that you have addressed each item on it. It's important that you have a clear understanding of all these concepts. <br/> <i> Why not try explaining them to one of your teammate to gauge your level of understanding? </i>

- Understand what is a [canister](../../manuals/chapters/chapter-1/CHAPTER-1.MD#what-is-a-canister) and how it relates to the concept of an [actor](../../manuals/chapters/chapter-1/CHAPTER-1.MD#the-actor-model).
- Understand the concept of [cycles](../../manuals/chapters/chapter-1/CHAPTER-1.MD#fuel-on-the-internet-computer-cycles) & being able to top-up acanister.
- Understand the difference between [update and query](../../manuals/chapters/chapter-1/CHAPTER-1.MD#update-vs-query) calls.
- Understand the differences between [a variable](../../manuals/chapters/chapter-2/CHAPTER-2.MD#📦-variables) declared with let & var.
- Understand what is [Candid](../../manuals/chapters/chapter-4/CHAPTER-4.MD#chapter-4-candid-the-language-of-the-internet-computer) & how to use the [Candid UI](https://github.com/motoko-bootcamp/motoko-starter/blob/main/manuals/chapters/chapter-4/CHAPTER-4.MD#--candid-ui-) to interact with your API.
- Understand that Motoko is a typed language and become familiar with the basic types: [Nat](https://github.com/motoko-bootcamp/motoko-starter/blob/main/manuals/chapters/chapter-3/CHAPTER-3.MD#-nat), [Int](https://github.com/motoko-bootcamp/motoko-starter/blob/main/manuals/chapters/chapter-3/CHAPTER-3.MD#-int) & [Bool](https://github.com/motoko-bootcamp/motoko-starter/blob/main/manuals/chapters/chapter-3/CHAPTER-3.MD#-bool).
- Being comfortable deploying, managing and interacting with canisters through [dfx](https://github.com/motoko-bootcamp/motoko-starter/blob/main/manuals/chapters/chapter-4/CHAPTER-4.MD#--using-the-terminal-dfx-).

> The first edition of Motoko Bootcamp was run in March 2022, fully online.

Good luck 🍀
